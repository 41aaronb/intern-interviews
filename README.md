# Intern Interviews

## Directions
Make a folder for yourself with your name inside `interns` (Check out `larry-lobster` for an example)

Make a copy of the `challenge` folder into your own folder

In `challenge`, open `index.html` in your preferred browser and you will see that there is a combination lock. Your goal is to write the logic behind the combination lock. Once the combination lock "unlocks" it will redirect to an "About me" page for yourself. Please look at Larry Lobster's `index.html` for inspiration. Feel free to take any styles from Larry Lobster's file and make it your own. We love to learn more about you and why you're interested about the internship at Lob.
